![portfolio image](./public/rp.png)

RP is a minimal, fast and beautiful portfolio website to flaunt my personal projects and work experience in tech. I have taken design inspiration from Britanny Chiang's portfolio website, with a lot of tweaks of my own. To visit and explore the website, click [here](https://ronit.pro)

Currently, Iâ€™m looking for an internship at a seed or series-A stage startup as a Full-Stack developer intern. If that rings a bell, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:pandaronit25@gmail.com).
